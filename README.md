# MazeSolver

This is a QT designed application which can generate mazes and apply algorithms such as DFS, BFS, and Djikstra to traverse them.

It has an option to show the step that is executed at a moment in time (in romanian language).

Also, if needed, the tree structure of the maze can be showed.
